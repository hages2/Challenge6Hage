#Weather Dashboard

Description: A website that allows users to search for a city then presents the current weather coniditons and a five-day forecast. The development process included creating a html, css, and javascript files and creating an account on the open weather API. Figuring out how to get the lat and lon from a city search was a challenge I encountered. I overcame this by searching for how to get the geolocation. In the future, this website could display more weather descriptions in the current weather. 

Built With HTML CSS Javascript jquery moment.js Bootstrap Open Weather API
